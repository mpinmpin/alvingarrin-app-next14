				<h2>About me</h2>
				<p>Hi, I&lsquo;m Alvin Garrin, a 33 y/o self-taught programmer and web developer from Depok, Indonesia.</p>
				<p>I&lsquo;m a programming and web development enthusiast for over 2 years, working with TypeScript, HTML, CSS, and React/Next.js. I have built simple apps here like weather app, blog pages and BMI calculator. I might work with larger projects in the near future.</p>
				<p>I also have strong interest in Data Science. I use Python and Scikit-learn in this regard.</p>
				<p>Aside from my recent interest in programming, I&lsquo;ve been freelancing as math/physics/chemistry private tutor for mid-high school students for over 9 years.</p>
				<p>Graduated in 2014, I also hold Bachelor of Engineering in Materials Engineering from Bandung Institute of Technology.</p>
